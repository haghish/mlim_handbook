\section{Syntax}

\texttt{mlim} is designed to be suitable for large datasets, despite its computational demands. However, for large datasets, you should be familiar with the syntax of the package as well as the machine you run your analysis on. There are settings for specifying number of CPU cores and RAM. The best place for reading the syntax is the \doclink{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlim/mlim.pdf}{package Vignette on CRAN}. I avoid reexplaining the syntax of the package because maintaining this document becomes  difficult. Instead, I will focus on the practical aspects of using \texttt{mlim} and thus, for the rest of this document, I will assume that you are familiar with the package syntax.
