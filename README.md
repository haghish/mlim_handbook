`mlim` Multiple Imputation Handbook
===================================

This repository includes the LaTeX files for the _`mlim` Multiple Imputation Handbook_, which is the manual for the [mlim multiple imputation R package](https://github.com/haghish/mlim).
The handbook is publically hosted on GitHub so that users can also contribute to it, add more examples, documentation, references, and make it a collaborative 
open-access resource for multiple imputation in R. So if you support the `mlim` mission, fork this repository and contribute to the manual. Even a grammar check would be highly appreciated. 

Cheers,

E. F. Haghish
